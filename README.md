### Why do that?

* Changing the task creation dates is a procedure that requires attention, responsibility, sincerity and respect for the team involved, as it will directly interfere the project's flow metrics.

### Who can do that?

* It should be done only by administrators and when there is a need to include an old task or when you forget to create a task at the right time.

### Changes will affect your team performance

* You should not take advantage of this functionality because it will decrease or increase the lead time, reaction time, cycle time, and other insights of your team performance.

### Everything will be recorded

* Keep in mind that every change (who did it and when did it) will be recorded at the page activity stream of the this task.
